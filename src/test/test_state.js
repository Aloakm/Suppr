          "instructions": "In his role as producer, Iwakami took a mostly hands-off approach. Due to Puella Magi Madoka Magica being an original series rather than an adaptation based off an already existing work, he described the main goal solely as \"coming up with a high-quality piece of entertainment.\" After helping to recruit the staff, he allowed them mostly free rein in developing the actual content of the story, providing minimal guidance from himself. After viewing the character designs that Aoki created, he became fully assured that he could trust the creative talent of the team. In an interview with Anime News Network after the series finished airing in Japan, Iwakami summed up his philosophy as \"I don't matter much; it's up to those talents to do their work. If something comes to a stand-still I might intervene, but they did an excellent job and I was very happy seeing the results in episode one.\"[3]",

During the early planning stage, Iwakami decided not to adapt an existing work in order to give Shinbo more freedom in his direction style.[2] Another goal of the project was to develop an anime that could appeal to a wider audience than the usual demographic for media within the magical girl genre. Iwakami and Shinbo intended for their series to be accessible to \"the general anime fan.\"[3] Shinbo then contacted Gen Urobuchi to work on the project as a scriptwriter and Ume Aoki as a character designer.[2] Takahiro Kishida was also enlisted to adapt Aoki's character designs for production of the television series.[4]",
